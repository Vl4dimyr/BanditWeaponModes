# BanditWeaponModes

## Description

This mod allows you to choose between 3 firing modes for the bandit's primary weapon: `Normal`, `Spam` and `DoubleDoubleTap`.
With `Spam` and `DoubleDoubleTap` mode you can just hold down the fire key and donÂ´t have to spam it.

The modes can be selected using the number keys `1`, `2` and `3`, or cycled through using the `mouse wheel` or [DPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad).
The current mode is displayed above the primary skill icon.

## Modes
